The title pretty implies what the challenge is all about, but I had to check it.   
When I ran the netcat command, I got the message:  
> Welcome!  
> Send the following number: 291196  
> 291196 (I sent it manually)
> Good, the next is: 569167   
> (I didn't send anything for a few seconds)   
> You're Too Slow For Me...   

As I suspected.   
Because the program can ask me to send a lot of numbers, I decided to write a simple python program to do it for me (in this repository).
So after I ran this program, after a while it respond with the flag **flag{S3ems_Like_Y0u_StiLl_FAsT}**.   
I took the program a while (like a minute) to end. So it's a good thing that I wrote it to do it for me :smile:   
This a well known challenge and it worths 25 points.
